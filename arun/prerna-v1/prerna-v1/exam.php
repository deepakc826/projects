            <h2>DEFINE:</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">IELTS stands for the International English Language Testing System. It is one of the most widely recognized and respected English language proficiency tests in the world. The purpose of IELTS is to assess the language ability of candidates who want to study, work, or migrate to countries where English is the primary language of communication.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The IELTS test evaluates a candidate's English language skills in four main areas:</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <ul class="purpose">
                  <li>Listening: Candidates listen to recordings of native English speakers and answer questions based on the content of the recordings.</li>
                  <li>Reading: Candidates read a variety of texts and answer questions to demonstrate their comprehension skills.</li>
                  <li>Writing: Candidates are required to complete two writing tasks. Task 1 usually involves describing visual information (e.g., graphs or charts), while Task 2 is an essay on a given topic.</li>
                  <li>Speaking: Candidates engage in a face-to-face interview with an IELTS examiner, where they discuss a range of topics to assess their speaking ability.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
            <br>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">IELTS offers two main versions of the test:</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <ul class="purpose">
                  <li>Academic IELTS: This version is typically taken by individuals applying for higher education programs or seeking professional registration in English-speaking countries.</li>
                  <li>General Training IELTS: This version is usually taken by candidates who plan to migrate to an English-speaking country for work, training programs, or other non-academic purposes.</li>
                  
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">IELTS does not have strict eligibility criteria, and in general, anyone can take the test regardless of age, gender, nationality, or educational background. The test is open to all individuals, including students, professionals, and individuals seeking immigration or work opportunities in English-speaking countries.</p>

            <h2>IELTS Exam Pattern:</h2>
            <p>Listening: The listening section consists of four recorded audio passages played through headphones. Candidates answer questions related to the content of these recordings. The duration of the listening test is approximately 30 minutes, including the time to transfer answers to the answer sheet.</p>

            <p>Reading: The reading section contains three or sometimes four texts taken from books, journals, magazines, or newspapers. Candidates answer questions based on the information provided in the texts. The duration of the reading test is 60 minutes.</p>

            <p>Writing: The writing section comprises two tasks. In Task 1, candidates have to describe information presented in a graph, table, chart, or diagram. In Task 2, candidates must write an essay responding to a specific topic or question. The duration of the writing test is 60 minutes.</p>

            <p>Speaking: The speaking test is a face-to-face interview conducted by a certified IELTS examiner. It is designed to assess the candidate's spoken English skills. The speaking test is usually held on a different day from the other sections and can last around 11 to 14 minutes.</p>

            <h2>IELTS Exam Mode: The IELTS test is available in two modes:</h2>
            <p>Paper-based IELTS: In this traditional mode, the test is conducted on paper. Candidates will receive the test booklets for the listening, reading, and writing sections, and they write their responses on the provided answer sheets.
            Computer-delivered IELTS: In this mode, the listening, reading, and writing sections are taken on a computer at an official IELTS test center. The speaking section, however, remains face-to-face with an examiner. The computer-delivered IELTS offers more frequent test dates and faster results compared to the paper-based format.</p>

            <p>To prepare effectively for the IELTS test, candidates can use official IELTS preparation materials, practice tests, and study resources available online or through authorized IELTS test centers.</p>

            <p>The IELTS exam fees can vary depending on the country and the test center where you choose to take the exam. Additionally, the fees may differ between the Academic and General Training versions of the test. As of my last update in September 2021, I can provide you with a general idea of the IELTS exam fees in different regions:</p>

            <p>India: The IELTS exam fee in India is generally around INR 16,250 RS .</p>
            <p>Please note that these figures are approximate and may have changed since my last update. Additionally, fees can vary depending on factors such as test mode (paper-based or computer-delivered) and the specific test center. To get the most up-to-date and accurate information about IELTS exam fees in your country or region, I recommend visiting the official IELTS website or contacting the nearest authorized IELTS test center.</p>

            <h3>EXAM VALIDITY</h3>
            <p>The validity of the IELTS exam results typically depends on the institution or organization that requires the test scores. In general, IELTS scores are considered valid for a period of two years from the test date.</p>

            <h3>PASSING SCORE</h3>
            <p>The IELTS test does not have a specific "passing" score. Instead, it uses a nine-band scale to report the results, which ranges from Band 1 (Non-User) to Band 9 (Expert User). Each band represents a different level of English language proficiency. The band score you need to achieve depends on the purpose for which you are taking the test, as different institutions and organizations have their own score requirements.</p>
